/// Execute an operation, catching Mach exceptions of specified types.
///
/// Warning!
/// Throwing an exception through a Swift frame can have undesirable side effects, such as leaking memory. The reason
/// for this is Swift wasn't designed to handle exceptions, and hence stack unwinding becauses an issue due to language
/// features. For example, simple stack unwinding ignores executing defer statements defined in the scope of a frame.
/// Sometimes, it is possible to perform the necessary clean up in the finally block. However, there is no guarantee
/// this works consistently with subsequent releases of the Swift language.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - types: The Mach exception types the function will catch, if thrown.
///   - listenerTimeout: The frequency (in milliseconds) that the exception listener checks for cancellation, which
///     occurs when the operation completes.
///   - dependencies: The dependencies required by the Mach exception helper. By default, the function creates the
///     necessary default dependencies. This parameter has the intent of providing dependency injection by software
///     unit tests.
///   - operation: A closure executed by the function that may throw Mach exceptions.
///   - finally: A "finally block" executed after the operation and any subsequent exception have executed.
///
/// - Throws: If the operation throws an Mach exception, then the function throws a `MachExceptionError`, which
///   specifies the Mach exception type, the associated code, and associated sub-code. It is possible for the
///   function to throw an `NSError` corresponding to errors returned by the Mach exception helper.

    // Start the listener task, which runs concurrently with the rest of this function. The listener task consists of
    // a loop that executes until the task is cancelled. On each iteration of the loop, the listener task invokes the
    // Mach exception handler's listener method, which can result in three cases:
    //
    //   - The Mach exception handler's listener method received a Mach exception, in which case it done.
    //
    //   - The Mach exception handler's listener method time's out, then the task simply checks if it is cancelled.
    //     If not, then it continues listening.
    //
    //   - The Mach exception handler's listener method encountered an error, which causes the task to throw the error.
    //
    // FIXIT: The function does nothing with errors thrown by this task, which can result in undesirable behavior.
    // Ideally, if the task throws an error, then it is desirable to terminate the operation and have this function
    // rethrow the error. However, there are competing requirements at play. It isn't necessarily desirable for the
    // operation to support asynchronous semantics, not to mention cancellation semantics. It may become necessary to
    // spawn the operation is in own thread, which this thread could terminate.

    //
    //   - The operation completes without throwing a Mach exception. In this case, the "finally block" excecutes and
    //     the listener task is cancelled.
    //
    //   - The operation throws a Mach exception. In this case, this function checks if the exception is indeed a Mach
    //     exception, in which case it rethrows it. It isn't necessary to worry about the Mach exception helper's
    //     listener, as in this case it will already have terminated.
    //
    //   - The operation throws some other exception, which causes the function to log the error and return.
